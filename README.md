# About me

With more than a decade of experience, I've got a real passion for IT.  
I'm a quick learner, always up for diving into new tech, and I'm all about ensuring top-notch quality.

As a Mobile/Web developer, I firmly believe in creating user-friendly interfaces that people will love.  
And as a backend developer (in Node.js), I'm all about building things to be fast, secure, and scalable.

### Main Skills (What I basically know better)

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-222222?style=for-the-badge&logo=react)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-43873f?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-f7dd1c?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=333333)
![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-3079c6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

The most exciting programming language for me is Javascript because it's versatile, easy to learn and it's in everywhere: frontend, backend and even in DB (hello mongo) and mobile. Therefore, I basically dedicated myself to it. ES5? ES6? Typescript? No worries. Leave it to me! üòâ

### Frontend/Mobile (What you see)

> As a Mobile/Web developer, I firmly believe in creating user-friendly interfaces that people will love.

I don't just get concerned on code itself. As a frontend I strive to develop an easy-to-use interface yet keeping it simple and lightweight trying to ensure the most seamless experience possible. I've relied on these tools over there (some more, some less) to achieve this on the projects for now.

### Backend/DB (You don't see it, but yet it's important)

![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=express)
![Socket.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/socket.io-f5f5f5?style=for-the-badge&logo=socket.io&logoColor=333333)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/mongodb-011e2b?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=01ec63)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgresql-336791?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-ffffff?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql)

It was love at first sight! üòç  
When I first met Node.js and its asynchronous nature, it seemed like the penny dropped and I finally got the idea of "real-time" applications. Since then, I've been working on projects with Node.js and its frameworks and libs. It's my go-to!

### Cloud/DevOps (Look at the sky)

![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/aws-222f3e?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws)
![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/heroku-5e468a?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku)
![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terraform-7b42bc?style=for-the-badge&logo=terraform&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-2496ed?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

> Do you know why do cloud providers make great musicians?  
> Because they're experts at syncing things up in perfect harmony! :badjoke:

Joking aside, these are the cloud services and tools I've worked with in my career (again some more, some less).  
These days, I can hardly imagine how to develop without cloud computing services. For every tool, a cloud service quickly comes to mind. Database? RDS or DynamoDB. Serverless? Lambda. Server? EC2, ECS. API GW? AWS API gateway. And so on.

### Tools

![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-f34e29?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)
![Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-24292f?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)
![Gitlab](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitlab-fdfdfd?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitlab)
![Webpack](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-111111?style=for-the-badge&logo=webpack)
![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-cb0300?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white)
![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/postman-ff6c37?style=for-the-badge&logo=postman&logoColor=white)
![Jira](https://img.shields.io/badge/jira-1d55c5?style=for-the-badge&logo=jira)
![Confluence](https://img.shields.io/badge/confluence-205080?style=for-the-badge&logo=confluence)
![Trello](https://img.shields.io/badge/trello-24729f?style=for-the-badge&logo=trello)

If I would add all the tools I know and I've worked in my life this list would be too long. These are some of the most used and important tools I've worked with everyday. Git, Gitflow concept, Gitlab CI/CD, Jira, among others.

### OS

![Mac OS](https://img.shields.io/badge/mac%20os-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&label=current)
![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-fdc725?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=333333)
![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/windows-0160b8?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows)

I've used Windows most of my life. I know it very well.  
I've been using Mac for 3 years (and I really love it!).  
I've been using Linux only for server and work.
